diybio postcard project

Dearest Garagistas,

In Jan 2012 I ran a little experiment called the diybio postcard project. I asked everyone in diybio to share short updates - a description & a link to a photo or blog post - about what a project they were working on via twitter, using the "#diybiohi" hashtag.

Jason Bobe and I picked seven of the entries (well, there only were seven, so it was easy) and had them printed on postcards and mailed all around the world to anyone who wanted one - for free. I think we mailed about 400 or so.

The idea was to create a sort of "pulse" of the diybio community that would be celebrated and recorded in physical artifacts - postcards. I think it worked pretty well, but there was a fair amount of manual labor involved.

Today I'm happy to announce the (re)launch of the diybio postcard project at postcards.diybio.org. We've written a simple webapp that grabs #diybio tweets from twitter and organizes them at the postcards page, simplifying a large part of the process.

Tweet an update with #diybiohi any time - just include a link to a photo of your work, optionally with more information - and it will get collected at postcards.diybio.org. Every quarter we'll pick the seven "best" entries (or maybe more, if there's too much awesomeness), print them on postcards, and mail them out to everyone.

For the next (Volume 2) postcard, we'll stop collecting entries and go to print around December 20th. Submissions received after that will go onto the next next postcard (Volume 3). Thereafter we'll print on a quarterly schedule, or with enough demand, a monthly schedule.

Would you enjoy getting a free postcard in your mailbox with diybio updates driven by the community? You can sign up here: http://bit.ly/diybiohi-subscribe.

Hope you submit an update! They'll *all* be archived at the postcards page, even the ones that don't make it to print.

Cheers, and Happy Biohacking!
